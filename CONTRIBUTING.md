## Preview documentation rendering

You can render the documentation locally by calling:

```
    make docs
```

The result is displayed in folder Documentation-GENERATED-temp.

## Run tests and apply coding guidelines

Install the requirements:

```
    make install
```

Apply automatic coding guideline fixes:

```
    make fix-cgl
```

Run tests:

```
    make test
```

If you don't have `make` installed or wish for finer control, you can run the tests directly:

```
    Build/Scripts/runTests.sh -s h
```
