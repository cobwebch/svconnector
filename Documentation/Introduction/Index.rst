Introduction
------------

The main idea of Connector services is to have a basic framework for
developing scripts that connect to third-party applications and
retrieve data from them. The new type for these services is
"connector" and every third-party application is represented by a
distinct sub-type.

This structure makes connection scripts reusable. It also makes them
easier to use thanks to a general API. Connector services can be
called both from the fronted and the backend. An example of extension
using connector services is “external\_import”.
