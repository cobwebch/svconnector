Introduction
------------

The main idea of Connector services is to have a basic framework for
developing scripts that connect to third-party applications and
retrieve data from them. These services are specifically tagged
(:code:`connector.service`) and each service has a type corresponding
to a third-party application. Detailed information is provided in the
:ref:`Developer's manual <developers>`.

This structure makes connection scripts reusable. It also makes them
easier to use thanks to a general API. Connector services can be
called both from the fronted and the backend. An example of extension
using connector services is “external\_import”.
